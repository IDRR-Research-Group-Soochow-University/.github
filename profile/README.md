# Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ We are the Research Group for IDRR (Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition), LPAI, Soochow University.

## About Us

We are a dedicated research team focused on Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition (IDRR), one of the most challenging and classical tasks in Natural Language Processing. Our work primarily centers on:

- **PDTB 2.0/3.0** - Penn Discourse TreeBank datasets
- **CoNLL16** - Shared Task on Shallow Discourse Parsing

## Research Interests

- Implicit discourse relation classification
- Discourse parsing and analysis
- Neural network architectures for NLP
- Representation learning for discourse relations
- **Large Language Model**
- **Reinforcement Learning** (like PPO and GRPO)
